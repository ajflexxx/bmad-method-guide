# Deep Dive: Checklists in BMad - Quality Gates and Validation

## Overview

Checklists in BMad are intelligent validation frameworks that act as **quality gates** at critical project junctures. They're not simple to-do lists - they're sophisticated validation tools with embedded AI instructions, conditional logic, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Checklist Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **LLM Instructions (`[[LLM: ]]` blocks)**
```markdown
[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work...

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
]]
```

These blocks provide:
- Context and purpose
- Execution methodology
- AI agent guidance
- Critical thinking prompts
- Validation approaches

#### 2. **Structured Validation Items**
```markdown
- [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met.
- [ ] Project builds successfully without errors.
```

Each item:
- Has clear, actionable criteria
- Can be marked: `[x]` Done, `[ ]` Not Done, `[N/A]` Not Applicable
- Requires evidence-based validation
- May have sub-items for detailed checking

#### 3. **Conditional Sections**
```markdown
[[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design...

[[BROWNFIELD ONLY]]
- Additional validation for existing systems
```

#### 4. **Interactive Elements**
```markdown
EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:
- Section by section (interactive mode)
- All at once (comprehensive mode)
```

## Types of Checklists

### 1. **Definition of Done (DoD) Checklists**
- **Purpose**: Self-validation before marking work complete

- **When**: After story creation

## Execution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Agent Self-Validation
```yaml
Agent Command: develop-story
↓
Implementation complete
↓
Agent runs: execute-checklist story-dod-checklist
↓
Self-assessment against criteria
↓
Mark story as "Ready for Review" or fix issues
```

### Pattern 2: Workflow Quality Gates
```yaml
Workflow Step: po validates artifacts
↓
Agent runs: execute-checklist po-master-checklist
↓
Comprehensive validation
↓
Pass: Continue workflow
Fail: Return to previous agents for fixes
```

### Pattern 3: Change Management
```yaml
Issue Discovery
↓
Agent runs: execute-checklist change-checklist
↓
Structured analysis of impact
↓
Plan adaptation strategy
```

## Checklist-Component Interactions

### Checklists ↔ Agents
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent] -->|declares dependency| C[Checklist]
    A -->|executes via command| T[execute-checklist task]
    T -->|loads and processes| C
    C -->|provides validation criteria| T
    T -->|generates report| A
```

**Agent-Checklist Mapping:**
- **Developer**: story-dod-checklist
- **Architect**: architect-checklist  
- **Product Owner**: po-master-checklist, change-checklist
- **Product Manager**: pm-checklist, change-checklist
- **Scrum Master**: story-draft-checklist
- **BMad-Master**: All checklists (universal access)

### Checklists ↔ Tasks
The `execute-checklist.md` task is the universal checklist processor:

```markdown
1. Load specified checklist
2. Parse LLM instructions
3. Process sections systematically
4. Execute validation against documents
5. Generate comprehensive report
6. Present findings with pass/fail rates
```

### Checklists ↔ Workflows
Workflows integrate checklists as quality gates:

```yaml
- agent: po
  validates: all_artifacts
  uses: po-master-checklist
  condition: po_checklist_issues
  notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix"
```

### Checklists ↔ Documents
Checklists validate against project artifacts:
- **PRD**: Requirements alignment
- **Architecture**: Technical design validation
- **Stories**: Implementation completeness
- **Code**: Quality standards adherence

## Advanced Checklist Features

### 1. **AI-Guided Validation**
```markdown
[[LLM: Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation]]
```

Checklists include AI instructions for:
- Critical thinking approaches
- Evidence requirements
- Risk assessment techniques
- Comprehensive analysis methods

### 2. **Conditional Logic**
```markdown
[[FRONTEND ONLY]] - Skip for backend projects
[[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] - Additional checks for existing systems
[[UI/UX ONLY]] - Skip sections for API-only projects
```

### 3. **Document Integration Requirements**
```markdown
Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:
1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document
3. frontend-architecture.md - If this is a UI project
```

### 4. **Execution Mode Selection**
```markdown
EXECUTION MODE:
- Section by section (interactive mode)
- All at once (comprehensive mode)
```

### 5. **Evidence-Based Validation**
```markdown
- Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from documents
- Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps
- Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong
```

## Checklist Processing Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Command: *execute-checklist name] --> B[Load execute-checklist.md task]
    B --> C[Parse checklist file]
    C --> D[Load required documents]
    D --> E{Execution Mode?}
    E -->|Interactive| F[Process section by section]
    E -->|Comprehensive| G[Process all sections]
    F --> H[Present findings per section]
    G --> I[Generate full report]
    H --> J[Get user confirmation]
    I --> K[Present comprehensive analysis]
    J --> L[Continue to next section]
    K --> M[Offer detailed section analysis]
    L --> N{More sections?}
    N -->|Yes| F
    N -->|No| O[Final summary report]
    M --> O
    O --> P[Pass/Fail determination]
```

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms

### 1. **Multi-Level Validation**
- **Self-assessment**: Agents validate their own work
- **Peer review**: Other agents validate cross-functionally
- **Comprehensive review**: PO validates entire project

### 2. **Evidence Requirements**
- Must cite specific document sections
- Provide concrete examples
- Explain reasoning for decisions

### 3. **Pass/Fail Criteria**
```markdown
✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
N/A: Not applicable to this case
```

### 4. **Iterative Improvement**
- Failed items return to responsible agents
- Re-validation after fixes
- Documentation of lessons learned
