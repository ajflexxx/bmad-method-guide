      creates: prototype_build
      time_limit: 8_hours
      
    - agent: playtester
      action: quick_feedback
      creates: playtest-results.md
      time_limit: 2_hours
```

### Step 5: Design Domain Templates

#### 5.1 Create Domain Document Templates

```yaml
template:
  id: game-design-doc
  name: Game Design Document
  version: 1.0
  output:
    format: markdown
    filename: docs/game-design.md
    title: "{{game_title}} - Game Design Document"
    
sections:
  - id: executive-summary
    title: Executive Summary
    instruction: |
      Create a compelling 1-page overview covering:
      - Core concept in one sentence
      - Target audience and platform
      - Unique selling points
      - Monetization strategy
    elicit: true
    
  - id: core-mechanics
    title: Core Mechanics
    sections:
      - id: primary-loop
        title: Primary Game Loop
        instruction: |
          Describe the 30-second to 2-minute core loop.
          What does the player do repeatedly?
        type: paragraphs
        elicit: true
        
      - id: progression
        title: Progression Systems
        instruction: |
          How does the player advance?
          - Leveling systems
          - Unlockables

        title: Performance Targets
        template: |
          - Platform: {{platform}}
          - Target FPS: {{fps}}
          - Max RAM: {{ram}}
          - Storage: {{storage}}
```

### Step 6: Create Domain Tasks

#### 6.1 Specialized Task Creation

```markdown
# game-design-brainstorming.md

## Purpose
Facilitate creative brainstorming for game concepts using game-specific techniques.

## Techniques
1. **Mechanic Mixing**: Combine mechanics from different genres
2. **Theme Reversal**: Take known theme and reverse it
3. **Constraint Design**: Design within specific limitations
4. **Player Story**: Start with player emotion/experience

## Process
1. Present initial concept
2. Apply selected technique
3. Generate 5 variations
4. Evaluate for:
   - Fun factor
   - Technical feasibility
   - Market fit
   - Uniqueness
5. Refine top concepts

## Output
- 3 refined game concepts
- Core mechanics for each
- Target audience analysis
- Risk assessment
```

### Step 7: Create Domain Checklists

#### 7.1 Quality Validation Checklists

```markdown
# game-design-checklist.md

## Game Design Document Validation

5. **Launch**: Release and marketing
6. **Post-Launch**: Updates and content

### Best Practices
- Prototype the core loop first
- Get feedback early
- Document all decisions
- Version control everything
- Plan for platform requirements
```

### Step 9: Create Agent Teams

#### 9.1 Bundle Agents into Teams

```yaml
# agent-teams/game-dev-team.yaml
bundle:
  name: Game Dev Team
  icon: ðŸŽ®
  description: Complete game development team
agents:
  - bmad-orchestrator
  - game-designer
  - game-architect
  - game-developer
  - level-designer
  - game-qa
workflows:
  - game-dev-greenfield.yaml
  - game-prototype.yaml
  - game-iteration.yaml
```

### Step 10: Core-Config Integration

#### 10.1 Extension Configuration Patterns

Expansion packs integrate with BMad's core configuration system:

```yaml
# config.yaml in expansion pack
name: game-dev-pack
version: 1.0.0
short-title: Game Dev Pack
description: Game Development expansion pack for BMad
author: Your Name

# Core-config extensions
extends: core-config
customTechnicalDocuments:
  - gameDesign:
      file: docs/game-design.md
      version: v1
      sharded: true
      shardedLocation: docs/game-design
      componentPattern: component-{n}*.md
  - levelDesign:
      file: docs/level-design.md
      sharded: false

# Additional context files for dev agent
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/game-design/mechanics.md
  - docs/game-design/assets.md
  - docs/architecture/game-engine.md

# Custom story location
devStoryLocation: docs/game-stories

# Pack-specific debug logging
devDebugLog: .ai/game-dev-debug.md
```

#### 10.2 Configuration Integration Process

**How BMad Detects Expansion Packs**:
1. BMad reads core-config.yaml
2. Checks for `extends` field pointing to expansion packs
3. Merges expansion pack configuration with core config
4. Updates agent dependencies with expansion-specific resources

**Configuration Merge Strategy**:
```yaml
# Core config provides base structure
core:
  prd: { file: docs/prd.md, version: v4 }
  architecture: { file: docs/architecture.md }

# Expansion adds domain-specific documents  
expansion:
  gameDesign: { file: docs/game-design.md, version: v1 }
  levelDesign: { file: docs/level-design.md }

# Result: merged configuration
merged:
  prd: { file: docs/prd.md, version: v4 }
  architecture: { file: docs/architecture.md }
  gameDesign: { file: docs/game-design.md, version: v1 }
  levelDesign: { file: docs/level-design.md }
```

#### 10.3 Agent Context Integration

**Dev Agent Context Loading**:
```yaml
# Core dev agent loads
core_context:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md

# Game dev expansion adds
expansion_context:
  - docs/game-design/mechanics.md
  - docs/game-design/assets.md
  - docs/architecture/game-engine.md

# Result: merged context for game dev
merged_context: [all above files]
```

**Benefits**:
- Domain-specific context always available
- Consistent implementation across game features
- No manual context management needed

### Step 11: Testing Your Pack

#### 11.1 Integration Testing

```bash
# Test pack loading
bmad init --pack ./expansion-packs/my-game-pack

# Verify configuration merge
cat bmad-core/core-config.yaml
# Should show merged configuration

# Verify agents load
/agent-list
# Should show game-specific agents

# Test workflow
/workflows
# Should show game workflows

# Run through complete workflow
/workflow-start game-dev-greenfield
```

#### 10.2 Create Test Project

```markdown
# Test checklist
- [ ] All agents activate correctly
- [ ] Templates generate valid documents
- [ ] Workflows complete successfully
- [ ] Tasks execute without errors
- [ ] Checklists validate properly
- [ ] Knowledge base accessible
```

## Best Practices for Pack Development

### 1. Maintain BMad Philosophy

```yaml
maintain:
  - Human-in-the-loop interaction
  - Document-centric workflow
  - Quality gates and validation
  - Clear agent responsibilities
  - Structured workflows
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Adaptations

```yaml
adapt:
  - Terminology to domain language
  - Processes to domain workflows
  - Validation to domain standards
  - Artifacts to domain outputs
  
preserve:
  - Core interaction patterns
  - Validation mechanisms
  - Document flow
  - Agent coordination
```

### 3. Reuse Core Components

```yaml
reuse:
  - Common tasks (create-doc, execute-checklist)
  - Base templates structure
  - Validation patterns
  - Workflow patterns
  
extend:
  - With domain-specific logic
  - Custom validation rules
  - Specialized processing
```

### 4. Documentation Standards

```markdown
# Every pack should include:
1. README.md - Overview and quick start
2. AGENTS.md - Agent descriptions and usage
3. WORKFLOWS.md - Workflow documentation
4. TEMPLATES.md - Template guide
5. EXAMPLES.md - Sample projects
```

## Build and Distribution System

### Expansion Pack Build Process

Expansion packs leverage BMad's build system for distribution:

#### 1. **Build Configuration**
```yaml
# build-config.yaml in expansion pack
build:
  enabled: true
  outputDir: dist
  formats: [web-bundle, ide-bundle, npm-package]
  
  # Custom build for expansion
  expansion:
    name: game-dev-pack
    includeCore: false  # Don't bundle core components
    webBundle:
      includeTeams: [game-dev-team]
      includeAgents: [game-designer, game-architect, game-developer]
    ideBundle:
      preserveStructure: true
      includeConfig: true
```

#### 2. **Build Script Integration**
```bash
# Build expansion pack bundles
node ../bmad-core/utils/web-builder.js --expansion game-dev-pack

# Output structure
dist/
â”œâ”€â”€ web/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ game-dev-team-bundle.txt    # Web UI bundle
â”œâ”€â”€ ide/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ game-dev-pack/              # IDE structure
â””â”€â”€ npm/
    â””â”€â”€ package/                     # NPM package
```

#### 3. **Dependency Resolution for Expansions**
```yaml
# Expansion pack dependencies handled by build system
dependencyStrategy:
  coreComponents: reference   # Reference core, don't bundle
  expansionComponents: bundle # Bundle expansion-specific
  sharedComponents: dedupe    # Deduplicate across expansions
```

**Build Process**:
1. Build system reads expansion config.yaml
2. Resolves dependencies (expansion + core references)
3. Creates web bundles with core references
4. Creates IDE bundles with proper structure
5. Generates NPM package with metadata

### Distribution Formats

#### **Web UI Bundles**
```markdown
# Game Dev Team Bundle
# Extends: BMad Core v4.0.0

    await this.buildWebBundles();
    
    // 3. Build IDE packages
    await this.buildIDEPackages();
    
    // 4. Build NPM package
    await this.buildNPMPackage();
  }
  
  async buildWebBundles() {
    // Reference core components, bundle expansion
    const builder = new WebBuilder({
      mode: 'expansion',
      coreReferences: true,
      bundleExpansion: true
    });
    
    return builder.buildTeams(this.config.teams);
  }
}
```
