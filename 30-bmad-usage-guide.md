## Journey 1: Greenfield Full-Stack Application

### Scenario
Building a new SaaS application from scratch with complete planning.

### Phase 1: Initialization

```bash
# User starts BMad
bmad init --team team-fullstack
```

**Decision Point 1**: Team Selection
- Chose `team-fullstack` for web application
- Alternative: `team-all` for exploration
- Alternative: `team-no-ui` for API only

### Phase 2: Workflow Selection

```yaml
# BMad Orchestrator activated
/workflows
> 1. greenfield-fullstack
> 2. greenfield-service
> 3. greenfield-ui

# User selects
/workflow-start greenfield-fullstack
```

**Decision Point 2**: Workflow Choice
- Selected full-stack for complete app
- Considered service-only for backend
- Considered ui-only for frontend

### Phase 3: Requirements Gathering

```markdown
# Analyst agent activated
@analyst

## Optional brainstorming
> Would you like to brainstorm first? 
User: Yes, let's explore payment processing options

## Brainstorming session
[Interactive brainstorming using facilitation techniques]

## Project brief creation
> create-project-brief
[Interactive document creation with elicitation]

Output: docs/project-brief.md
```

**Decision Point 3**: Depth of Analysis
- Chose brainstorming for unclear requirements
- Could skip for well-defined projects
- Could add market research for competitive analysis

### Phase 4: Product Planning

```markdown
# PM agent activated
@pm

## PRD Creation
> create-prd
[Uses project brief as input]
[Interactive creation with 1-9 elicitation options]

Output: docs/prd.md
```

**Key Artifacts**:
- Project brief → PRD transformation
- Epic breakdown
- User stories defined
- Success metrics established

### Phase 5: UX Design

```markdown
# UX Expert activated
@ux-expert

## Frontend specification
> create-front-end-spec
[Design system, components, user flows]

## Optional: AI UI Generation
> generate-ai-frontend-prompt
[Creates prompt for v0, Lovable, etc.]

User: *Goes to v0.dev with prompt*
User: *Downloads generated UI code*
```

**Decision Point 4**: UI Generation Method
- Chose AI generation for speed
- Could design manually
- Could use existing templates

### Phase 6: Architecture Design

```markdown
# Architect activated
@architect

## Architecture document
> create-architecture
[Technical stack, patterns, infrastructure]
[Incorporates v0 generated structure]

## Suggests PRD updates
"Based on technical constraints, suggest adding story for caching layer"

Output: docs/architecture.md
```

**Feedback Loop**:
- Architecture informs PRD changes
- PM updates PRD with new stories
- Maintains alignment

### Phase 7: Validation

```markdown
# PO agent activated
@po

## Run master checklist
> validate-all
[Checks PRD, architecture, frontend spec]

## Issues found
- Missing error handling stories
- Inconsistent API naming

## Resolution
[Return to PM and Architect for fixes]
[Re-validation passes]
```

**Quality Gate**:
- Must pass before proceeding
- Ensures consistency
- Catches issues early

### Phase 8: Document Sharding

```markdown
# PO shards documents
> shard docs/prd.md
> shard docs/architecture.md

Output: 
- docs/prd/epic-1-user-auth.md
- docs/prd/epic-2-payments.md
- docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- docs/architecture/api-design.md
```

**Preparation for Development**:
- Documents ready for AI processing
- Manageable chunks
- Parallel development enabled

### Phase 9: Development Cycle

```markdown
# Switch to IDE environment
cd project-folder
code .  # Open VS Code

# SM agent in new chat
@sm
> *create
[Creates story-1 from epic-1]

Output: docs/stories/epic-1/story-1-login.md
```

**Story Creation Loop**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    SM[SM: Create Story] --> Dev[Dev: Implement]
    Dev --> QA[QA: Review]
    QA --> Next{More Stories?}
    Next -->|Yes| SM
    Next -->|No| Complete[Epic Complete]
```

### Phase 10: Implementation

```markdown
# Dev agent in new chat
@dev
[Loads story-1, architecture, coding standards]

## Implementation
- Creates src/auth/login.component.ts
- Updates src/app/app.module.ts
- Writes tests
- Updates story with file list

Status: story-1 → Review
```

**Development Pattern**:
- Story-driven development
- Test-first approach
- Documentation updates
- File tracking

### Phase 11: Quality Review

```markdown
# QA agent in new chat
@qa
> review-story

## Review results
✅ Code quality good
✅ Tests passing
⚠️ Missing error handling
❌ No loading state

## Actions
- Fixed loading state directly
- Left checklist for error handling

Status: story-1 → Done (with notes)
```

### Phase 12: Iteration

```markdown
# Continue for all stories
Repeat: SM → Dev → QA cycle

## Progress tracking
Epic 1: 5/5 stories complete
Epic 2: 3/5 stories complete
Epic 3: 0/4 stories complete
```

- Maps component structure
- Identifies patterns
- Documents constraints

Output: docs/brownfield-architecture.md
```

**Discovery Process**:
- Automatic codebase analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Dependency mapping
- Technical debt identification

### Phase 4: Enhancement Planning

```markdown
# PM agent
@pm
> create-brownfield-prd

## Uses discovered architecture
- Works within constraints
- Leverages existing patterns
- Plans incremental changes

Output: docs/prd.md (enhancement focused)
```

### Phase 5: Architecture Updates

```markdown
# Architect agent
@architect

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Planning Pyramid

```
Large Project:  ████████████ Planning
                ████ Implementation

Small Project:  ██ Planning
                ████████ Implementation

Prototype:      █ Planning
                ███ Implementation
```

### Pattern 2: The Feedback Loop

```mermaid
graph LR
    Plan --> Build
    Build --> Validate
    Validate --> Refine
    Refine --> Plan
```

### Pattern 3: The Quality Gates

```
Requirements → [Gate 1: Completeness] →
Design → [Gate 2: Feasibility] →
Architecture → [Gate 3: Consistency] →
Implementation → [Gate 4: Functionality] →
Deployment
```
