- Notes: ✅ All agent files verified, structure accurate, Test Architect role correction applied. Document now fully accurate.

### Session 2: 02-bmad-philosophy-architecture.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Tasks don't use frontmatter to reference templates (they use command definitions/runtime discovery)
  2. Lazy loading has exceptions (core-config.yaml always loaded, dev agent loads additional files)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected task description to remove frontmatter claim
  ✅ Added lazy loading exceptions documentation
- Notes: All architectural structure verified accurate. Component relationships confirmed. Only minor corrections needed for implementation details.

### Session 3: 10-bmad-agents-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Missing agent names for several core agents (Dev=James, PM=John, PO=Sarah, SM=Bob, UX=Sally)
  2. QA agent file is named qa.md, not test-architect.md
  3. QA agent commands are simplified (review not review-story, gate not qa-gate, trace not trace-requirements)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Added missing agent names for all core agents
  ✅ Corrected QA agent command names to match actual implementation
  ✅ Added note that QA agent file is qa.md (not test-architect.md)
- Notes: All agent identities, personas, and commands now verified accurate. Game designer (Alex) confirmed in expansion pack.

### Session 4: 11-bmad-tasks-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Task paths listed as `/workspace/common/tasks/` instead of relative `/common/tasks/`
  2. Frontmatter description was too generic - only some tasks use it (e.g., facilitate-brainstorming-session.md)
  3. QA gate file location incorrectly stated as fixed path instead of config-driven
  4. QA gate schema showed wrong field names (priority/category/issue instead of id/severity/finding/suggested_action)
  5. Test Architect commands had incorrect names (e.g., review-story instead of review {story})
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected task location paths to be relative
  ✅ Clarified that frontmatter is optional and only some tasks use it
  ✅ Fixed QA gate location to reference core-config.yaml
  ✅ Corrected QA gate schema fields to match actual implementation
  ✅ Fixed Test Architect command names to match actual qa.md
- Notes: Task structure and execution patterns verified accurate. Common vs core tasks distinction confirmed. Testing tasks properly documented.

### Session 5: 12-bmad-templates-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Template versions vary (most are v2.0, qa-gate is v1.0)
  2. Output formats vary (most use markdown, qa-gate uses YAML)
  3. Frontmatter rarely used for template references (primarily command parameters)
  4. Missing brownfield-architecture template in agent list
  5. Missing Test Architect (qa) agent ownership of qa-gate template
  6. qa-gate structure was overly detailed - actual template is minimal with extensive examples section
  7. Story template has unique agent_config section for editable sections
  8. Variables can use dot notation (qa.qaLocation) to reference config values
  9. List types can have additional properties (prefix, examples, template)
  10. Section types include template-text, choice, paragraphs (not just text)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected template version information (v1.0 for qa-gate, v2.0 for most)
  ✅ Fixed output format variations (YAML for qa-gate)
  ✅ Clarified template referencing methods (command params primary)
  ✅ Added brownfield-architecture to architect's templates
  ✅ Added Test Architect ownership of qa-gate template
  ✅ Simplified qa-gate structure to match actual minimal defaults
  ✅ Added agent_config pattern from story template
  ✅ Documented dot notation for config references
  ✅ Enhanced list type documentation with additional properties
  ✅ Expanded section type documentation
- Notes: Template structure accurately documented. All 13 templates verified. Key insight: templates are minimal by default with extensive optional fields documented in examples sections.

### Session 6: 13-bmad-checklists-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Missing list of actual 6 core checklists (architect, change, pm, po-master, story-dod, story-draft)
  2. execute-checklist task is in /common/tasks/, not bmad-core/tasks/
  3. Checklists loaded from {root}/checklists/, not absolute paths
  4. Execution modes are "interactive" and "YOLO" (not "comprehensive")
  5. Story DoD categories were generic instead of actual 7 specific categories
  6. Missing PM checklist as separate type (was lumped with others)
  7. Change checklist called "Navigation" not "Management" in actual implementation
  8. Task supports fuzzy matching for checklist names
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Added complete list of 6 core checklists with item counts
  ✅ Corrected execute-checklist task location to /common/tasks/
  ✅ Fixed checklist loading path to {root}/checklists/
  ✅ Updated execution mode names (YOLO instead of comprehensive)
  ✅ Listed actual Story DoD categories (1-7)
  ✅ Added PM checklist as separate type with details
  ✅ Renamed to "Change Navigation Checklists"
  ✅ Added fuzzy matching capability note
- Notes: Checklists are sophisticated validation frameworks with extensive LLM instructions. All 6 checklists verified. execute-checklist task in common folder, not core.

### Session 7: 14-bmad-workflows-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Documentation claimed all brownfield workflows have enhancement classification routing
  2. Actually only brownfield-fullstack.yaml has this routing (single story/small feature/major enhancement)
  3. brownfield-service.yaml and brownfield-ui.yaml go directly to comprehensive planning
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Clarified that complexity routing only exists in brownfield-fullstack workflow
  ✅ Added notes to brownfield-service and brownfield-ui that they skip classification routing
- Notes: All 6 workflows verified. Structure, handoffs, sharding, and Mermaid diagrams all accurate. Only discrepancy was overgeneralization of brownfield routing pattern.

### Session 8: 15-bmad-teams-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found: None - documentation is fully accurate
- Updates Made: None needed
- Notes: All 4 core teams verified (team-all, team-fullstack, team-ide-minimal, team-no-ui). Agent lists, workflow associations, and bundle structures all match source exactly. Team descriptions, icons, and purposes accurately documented. Distribution folder contains .txt versions as expected.

### Session 9: 16-bmad-configuration-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Missing `qa` configuration section with `qaLocation: docs/qa`
  2. Incorrectly documented `agentCoreDump` which doesn't exist in actual config
  3. Incorrectly documented `CLAUDE.md` integration which is in .gitignore
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Added complete QA configuration section with qaLocation parameter
  ✅ Documented QA artifacts structure (gates/ and assessments/ folders)
  ✅ Added QA config effects on agents (Test Architect) and tasks (qa-gate, nfr-assess, test-design)
  ✅ Removed non-existent agentCoreDump section
  ✅ Removed CLAUDE.md v5.0 section (file is gitignored)
  ✅ Updated Required Fields to include qa.qaLocation
  ✅ Renumbered all configuration sections accordingly
- Notes: Configuration is the control center. qa.qaLocation is critical for Test Architect operations. All QA artifacts follow structured paths under this location.

### Session 10: 17-bmad-data-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Missing two data files: test-levels-framework.md and test-priorities-matrix.md
  2. technical-preferences.md content described as "filled by users" but actually starts with "None Listed"
  3. elicitation-methods.md described as "30+ methods" but should be "Multiple methods"
  4. brainstorming-techniques.md usage pattern was oversimplified (interactive one-at-a-time not batch selection)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Added complete documentation for test-levels-framework.md (test level decision guide)
  ✅ Added complete documentation for test-priorities-matrix.md (P0-P3 priority classification)
  ✅ Clarified technical-preferences.md starts empty with "None Listed"
  ✅ Updated brainstorming techniques to show interactive usage pattern
  ✅ Added summary list of all 6 core data files
  ✅ Added new "Testing Frameworks" category to data resource types
  ✅ **ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS ADDED**:
  - Data as behavioral modifiers section
  - Task-exclusive loading pattern documentation
  - Interactive conversational loading vs batch
  - Granular section loading explanation
  - Behavioral hierarchy of data types
  - Updated Key Insights to reflect deeper understanding
- Notes: Major discovery - BMAD's data architecture isn't about storage but behavior modification through selective, contextual loading patterns. These insights have been documented in:
  - 17-bmad-data-reference.md: Added behavioral modifiers section, task-exclusive loading pattern, interactive conversational loading
  - 02-bmad-philosophy-architecture.md: Added principles 7-12 covering discovered patterns
  - 10-bmad-agents-reference.md: Added Advanced Agent Patterns section
  - 16-bmad-configuration-reference.md: Added Advanced Configuration Patterns section
  - 24-bmad-architectural-patterns.md: Created new synthesis document for all patterns
  - 99-bmad-index.md: Updated to reference new architectural patterns document

### Session 11: 20-bmad-workflow-patterns.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. v5.0 testing integration described as embedded in workflow phases, but actually QA is optional/separate
  2. Test Architect shown as integrated throughout workflow, but workflows show "OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat)"
  3. Missing critical pattern: Manual save instructions in workflow notes
  4. Missing clean slate enforcement pattern documentation
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected v5.0 testing integration to show advisory optional model
  ✅ Fixed Test Architect positioning as separate chat session
  ✅ Added "Architectural Patterns Discovered" section with 5 key patterns:
  - Clean Slate Enforcement Pattern
  - Artifact-Driven State Management
  - Manual Save Pattern
  - Optional Advisory Pattern
  - Sharding as Context Optimization
    ✅ Enhanced summary to include discovered patterns
- Notes: Major architectural insights about workflow orchestration. Workflows are declarative sequences that maintain state through artifacts, not memory. Each agent activation is isolated (clean slate). User manually saves outputs maintaining control. QA is advisory and optional, not embedded in workflow sequence.

### Session 12: 21-bmad-document-patterns.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. v5.0 QA patterns overclaimed - described elaborate scoring system that doesn't exist
  2. Document state machine overclaimed - no automated state transitions, just manual status updates
  3. Distribution tracking overclaimed - no automated logging of document handoffs
  4. Version management overclaimed - relies on git, not sophisticated versioning system
  5. Archive patterns overclaimed - no .archive folder structure, just git history
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Simplified QA documentation pattern to match actual qa-gate template
  ✅ Replaced automated state machine with manual status field tracking
  ✅ Removed distribution tracking claims
  ✅ Clarified version tracking as git-based with manual notes
  ✅ Updated archive section to reflect git persistence model
  ✅ Added "Architectural Patterns Discovered" section with 5 key patterns:
  - Configuration-First Document Management
  - Permission-Based Section Editing
  - Sharding as Token Optimization
  - Template-Driven Consistency
  - Manual State Management Philosophy
    ✅ Rewrote summary to reflect pragmatic reality vs overclaimed sophistication
- Notes: Core document flow patterns are accurate (creation, validation, sharding, implementation). Main issue was implying more automation than exists. BMAD uses pragmatic manual controls rather than complex automated systems. This aligns with the "clean slate" and "manual save" patterns discovered in Session 11.

### Session 13: 22-bmad-execution-patterns.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Document title was misleading - focused only on checklist execution, not general execution patterns
  2. Missing broader execution patterns (command resolution, parameter injection, modal execution)
  3. Missing task authority pattern documentation
  4. Missing elicitation enforcement pattern
  5. Missing context loading patterns (especially dev agent special case)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Renamed document to "BMAD Execution Patterns" (broader scope)
  ✅ Added Part 1: Command Resolution and Execution section
  ✅ Added REQUEST-RESOLUTION pattern documentation
  ✅ Added Parameter Injection Pattern with examples
  ✅ Added Task Authority Rules section
  ✅ Restructured checklist content as Part 2 (example of execution patterns)
  ✅ Added Part 8: Advanced Execution Patterns with:
  - Elicitation Pattern
  - Modal Execution Pattern
  - Fuzzy Matching Pattern
  - Context Loading Pattern (including dev agent exception)
    ✅ Added "Architectural Patterns Discovered" section with 8 key patterns:
  - Task Authority Pattern
  - Parameter Injection Architecture
  - Modal Execution Design
  - Elicitation Enforcement
  - Context Minimalism
  - Fuzzy Resolution Pattern
  - Task-Mediated Resource Access
  - Clean Slate Enforcement
    ✅ Updated summary to reflect broader execution architecture
- Notes: Document now properly covers all execution patterns, not just checklists. Checklist execution serves as a detailed example of the broader patterns. Key insight: Task authority is absolute - tasks override agent behavioral constraints to ensure consistent execution.

### Session 14: 23-bmad-distinction-patterns.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Document was too narrowly focused on just Task vs Data distinction
  2. Missing other major distinctive patterns (Clean Slate, Manual Save, Hard Stops)
  3. Missing architectural philosophy behind the distinctions
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Renamed document to "BMAD Distinction Patterns: What Makes BMAD Unique"
  ✅ Kept Part 1 about Task vs Data distinction (verified accurate)
  ✅ Added Part 2: Clean Slate Architecture - "New Chat" requirement pattern
  ✅ Added Part 3: Elicitation Enforcement - Hard Stop pattern
  ✅ Added Part 4: Strategy Pattern Without Classes
  ✅ Added Part 5: Advisory vs Blocking QA
  ✅ Added Part 6: Configuration-First Extensibility
  ✅ Added comprehensive "Architectural Patterns Discovered" section with 10 patterns
  ✅ Added "Philosophy Behind the Distinctions" section
  ✅ Enhanced conclusion to tie all patterns to coherent philosophy
- Notes: Major expansion of document scope. Original Task vs Data content was accurate and insightful. Added 5 new major distinction patterns discovered through source verification. Key insight: BMAD's distinctions form a coherent philosophy prioritizing user agency, predictability, extensibility, pragmatism, and transparency.

### Session 15: 30-bmad-usage-guide.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Installation command was incorrect (showed `bmad init --team` instead of `npx bmad-method install`)
  2. Workflow selection commands incorrect (showed `/workflow-start` instead of `*workflow`)
  3. Missing critical "Manual Save Required" instructions throughout workflow phases
  4. Missing prominent "Clean Slate Pattern" explanation for new chat requirements
  5. QA command shown as `review-story` instead of just `review`
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected installation commands to use npx bmad-method install
  ✅ Fixed workflow selection to use *workflow-guidance and *workflow commands
  ✅ Added "IMPORTANT: Manual Save Required" sections after each document generation
  ✅ Added new "Critical BMad Patterns to Understand" section at top
  ✅ Emphasized "NEW CHAT (clean slate required)" for each agent activation
  ✅ Fixed QA review command from review-story to review
  ✅ Added explicit manual save steps showing user copying and saving files
- Notes: The usage guide now accurately reflects the actual BMad workflow including the critical clean slate and manual save patterns that are fundamental to understanding how BMad works. These patterns were discovered in previous sessions but weren't prominently featured in the usage guide.
- **IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: Manual save is required for Web UI (planning phase) but NOT for IDE (development phase). Modern AI IDEs like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf CAN and DO create/modify files directly. The documentation has been updated to clarify this critical distinction.

### Session 16: 31-bmad-expansion-guide.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Documented non-existent GCP/Vertex AI expansion pack with extensive features
  2. Described complex configuration extension system (`extends: core-config`) that doesn't exist
  3. Detailed build/distribution system for expansion packs that isn't implemented
  4. NPM package distribution described but not available
  5. Automated installation commands (`bmad install-pack`) don't exist
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Removed entire fictional GCP expansion pack section
  ✅ Simplified configuration to match actual minimal config.yaml structure
  ✅ Removed complex build system documentation
  ✅ Updated installation to reflect manual directory copying
  ✅ Clarified that expansion packs are self-contained, not config-merging
  ✅ Added note about current vs aspirational features
  ✅ Focused on real expansion packs (game dev, creative writing, devops)
- Notes: Expansion packs are simpler than documented - they're self-contained domain adaptations that reference core components through dependencies. No complex merging or build systems. The power is in domain-specific agents, workflows, and templates.

### Session 17: 18-bmad-build-system-reference.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Documented non-existent v5.0 dual publishing strategy (stable/@latest vs beta/@beta)
  2. Incorrect web-builder.js location (`/bmad-core/utils/` instead of `/tools/builders/`)
  3. Wrong installation commands (install.sh/install.ps1 don't exist - uses Node.js installer)
  4. Incorrect dist/ structure - missing individual agent names and expansion packs structure
  5. Wrong bundle format examples - actual format includes web instructions header
  6. Fictional command-line interface options that don't exist
  7. Non-existent build configuration in core-config.yaml
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected version to actual 4.39.1 (not 5.0.0)
  ✅ Fixed installation methods to use `npx bmad-method install` and Node.js installer
  ✅ Updated web-builder.js location to correct `/tools/builders/` path
  ✅ Corrected dist/ structure to show actual agent files and expansion pack organization
  ✅ Fixed bundle format to match actual web bundle format with START/END separators
  ✅ Replaced fictional CLI with actual npm scripts from package.json
  ✅ Added "Architectural Patterns Discovered" section with 6 build system insights:
  - Installer-as-Tool Pattern (Node.js CLI tool with executable permissions)
  - Dual Distribution Strategy (IDE files vs web bundles)
  - Dependency-Driven Bundling (WebBuilder + DependencyResolver)
  - Expansion Pack Integration (bundling alongside core)
  - Web-Compatible Path Convention (.bmad-core/ prefix)
  - CLI-First Architecture (tools/cli.js modular commands)
- Notes: Build system is Node.js-based, not shell scripts. WebBuilder creates .txt bundles for web AI upload. Major architectural insight: installation is handled by sophisticated Node.js CLI tool, not basic scripts.

### Session 18: 24-bmad-architectural-patterns.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. **CRITICAL ERROR DISCOVERED**: Document incorrectly claimed "Manual State Management" as universal pattern
  2. Reality: Manual save ONLY applies to Web UI (planning phase), NOT IDE (development phase)
  3. Missing critical patterns from Sessions 1-17 (Clean Slate, Task Authority, Elicitation Enforcement)
  4. Architectural discoveries section needed enhancement with verification insights
- Updates Made:
  ✅ **CORRECTED Web UI vs IDE distinction** - Manual save is Web UI only, IDE has direct file modification
  ✅ Added Clean Slate Architecture pattern with proper environment distinction
  ✅ Added Task Authority Pattern (tasks override agent behavioral constraints)
  ✅ Added Elicitation Enforcement (Hard Stop pattern)
  ✅ Added Advisory vs Blocking QA Pattern
  ✅ Added Manual State Management Philosophy (corrected to Web UI only)
  ✅ Added Strategy Pattern Without Classes
  ✅ Enhanced pattern categories to include Quality & Control section
  ✅ Updated checklist to be organized by Architecture, UX, Quality, and Expansion Pack specific
- Notes: **MAJOR CORRECTION**: User caught critical error about manual save being universal. Source code verification shows Web UI agents have "no file system to write to" while IDE agents can directly create/modify files. This distinction is fundamental to understanding BMad's dual-environment architecture.

### Session 19: 32-bmad-troubleshooting-guide.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Incorrect workflow command syntax - shown as "/workflow-start" instead of "\*workflow"
  2. Outdated installation commands - shown as "bmad init --team" instead of "npx bmad-method install"
  3. Missing actual BMAD error messages from source code verification
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Fixed workflow command syntax to use "\*workflow" pattern
  ✅ Updated installation commands to use correct "npx bmad-method install/update"
  ✅ Added recovery notes about proper command prefixes
  ✅ Enhanced error reference table with actual BMAD error messages from source
- Notes: Document was largely accurate for troubleshooting scenarios. Key findings: ALL BMAD commands use \* prefix (not just orchestrator), workflow commands follow established patterns, error messages are consistent across codebase. Installation evolution from simple scripts to Node.js CLI properly documented.

### Session 20: 90-bmad-glossary.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. PM agent incorrectly named Mary instead of John
  2. Dual Publishing incorrectly removed - it DOES exist (@stable and @beta tags confirmed)
  3. CLAUDE.md status not clarified (it's .gitignored)
  4. Google ADK doesn't exist - replaced with actual expansion packs
  5. Test Architect file is qa.md, not test-architect.md
  6. Missing agent names list (personification as memory aid)
  7. Frontmatter example path used wrong quote style
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Corrected PM agent name from Mary to John
  ✅ Restored Dual Publishing with correct @stable/@beta tags
  ✅ Added Current Version: v4.39.1
  ✅ Clarified CLAUDE.md is .gitignored (not distributed)
  ✅ Replaced fictional Google ADK with actual expansion packs list
  ✅ Added note that Test Architect file is qa.md
  ✅ Added Agent Names section listing all personifications
  ✅ Fixed frontmatter example to use single quotes
- Notes: Key discovery - user correctly identified that @stable tag exists (found in README.md line 79). Beta tags confirmed in tools/preview-release-notes.js. Stuck to correcting actual terms from source, not adding interpretive patterns.
- **Additional cleanup**: Removed interpretative patterns not in source:
  - Removed "Advisory Approach" (term not used in source)
  - Removed "Quality Advisory Framework" (term not used in source)
  - Corrected "Context Engineering" to "Context-Engineered Development" (actual term from README.md)
  - Changed "v5.0 Terms" to "Quality & Testing Terms" (BMAD is v4.39.1)
  - Removed "(v5.0)" labels from terms that exist in current version

### Session 20: 90-bmad-glossary.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found:
  1. Missing YOLO Mode term (legitimate BMAD concept found in multiple task files)
- Updates Made:
  ✅ Added YOLO Mode definition with source references from execute-checklist.md, create-doc.md, and correct-course.md
- Notes: Glossary was ~98% accurate already. All agent names verified correct (Mary, John, Winston, Sarah, Bob, James, Quinn, Sally). All technical terms accurate. Version (v4.39.1) and dual publishing (@stable/@beta) confirmed in source. CLAUDE.md correctly noted as .gitignored. Expansion packs list accurate. Avoided adding interpretative patterns (Clean Slate, Manual Save, Hard Stop) that aren't explicit BMAD terms in source code.

### Session 21: 99-bmad-index.md

- Status: [x] Complete
- Issues Found: None - index was already corrected in previous session
- Validation Performed:
  ✅ Verified all 21 documents are correctly listed in index
  ✅ Confirmed document listing matches actual files in /workspace/bmad-documentation/
  ✅ Spot-checked section headers in documents (24, 18) match index descriptions
  ✅ Verified cross-references point to existing documents
  ✅ Confirmed categories are logical: Foundations (01-09), Core Components (10-19), System Interactions (20-29), Implementation Guides (30-39), Reference (90-99)
- Notes: Index is 100% accurate. Previous session already fixed the missing 18-bmad-build-system-reference.md and removed non-existent document references (33, 34, 35). All cross-references valid. Quick Reference by Goal section correctly points to existing documents only.

### Session 22: Final Review & Summary

- Status: [x] Complete
- Cross-Document Consistency:
  ✅ Agent names consistent across all documents (Mary, John, Winston, Sarah, Bob, James, Quinn, Sally, Alex)
  ✅ Core concepts properly aligned (Clean Slate, Manual Save for Web UI only, Advisory QA)

## BMAD VERSION INFO:

- Current Version: 4.39.1
- Repository: /workspace/bmad-method/
- Last Updated: Recent pull completed in this session
- Key Changes: Minor installer and script organization updates

## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY:

For each document:

1. Read our current documentation section by section
2. Identify specific claims about BMAD structure, files, or behavior
3. Check those claims against actual BMAD source files
4. Note any discrepancies (missing features, wrong paths, outdated examples)
5. **ANALYZE DEEPER PATTERNS**: Look beyond "what files exist" to understand HOW components interact
6. **DOCUMENT BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS**: Capture loading patterns, interaction modes, and architectural principles
7. **UPDATE THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION**: Add insights to the appropriate documentation files:
   - Philosophy insights → 02-bmad-philosophy-architecture.md
   - Component patterns → Their respective reference docs (10-17)
   - Cross-cutting patterns → 24-bmad-architectural-patterns.md
8. **RECORD IN THIS PLAN**: Note what was discovered and where it was documented
9. Focus on understanding the "why" behind the design, not just cataloging what exists

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:

### Where to Document Discoveries:

1. **Technical Corrections**: Update in the specific reference document being verified
2. **Philosophical Insights**: Add to 02-bmad-philosophy-architecture.md under appropriate principle
3. **Component-Specific Patterns**: Add to that component's reference doc (10-17) in an "Advanced Patterns" section
4. **Cross-Cutting Architectural Patterns**: Add to or update 24-bmad-architectural-patterns.md
5. **This Plan**: Record WHAT was discovered and WHERE it was documented

### Questions to Ask During Verification:

- What pattern does this reveal about BMAD's architecture?
- Why was it designed this way (not just how)?
- What does this tell us about building expansion packs?
- Is this a correction or a deeper insight?
- Where should this knowledge live in the documentation?

## KEY LEARNINGS FROM VERIFICATION:

### Discovered Architectural Patterns:

#### Resource Loading Patterns:

1. **Data as Behavioral Modifiers** (Session 10): Data files don't just store information - they modify agent/task behavior through different interaction patterns (conversational, interactive, criterial, configurational)

2. **Task-Exclusive Resource Loading** (Session 10): Some resources bypass agent dependencies entirely, creating indirect knowledge transfer (Agent→Command→Task→Data, not Agent→Data)

3. **Granular Context Management** (Session 10): Tasks can load specific sections of files, not entire documents, keeping context windows minimal

4. **Lazy Loading with Exceptions** (Session 2): Core-config always loaded, dev agent loads additional context - showing role-based context expansion

#### Interaction Design Patterns:

5. **Interactive vs. Batch Processing** (Session 10): Techniques use conversational turn-taking patterns, not menu selection

6. **Runtime Binding Pattern** (Session 2): Tasks use command definitions and runtime discovery instead of static frontmatter references

7. **Parameter Injection Pattern** (Session 4): Commands like `review {story}` show dynamic parameter substitution

8. **Fuzzy Command Resolution** (Session 6): User-friendly command matching allows approximate inputs

#### Configuration & Customization:

9. **Configuration-First Architecture** (Session 4): Critical paths (QA gate location) are config-driven, not hardcoded

10. **Config Namespace Traversal** (Session 5): Dot notation (qa.qaLocation) enables deep config value access

11. **Agent-Specific Customization** (Session 5): Templates have agent_config sections for role-specific behavior

12. **Pluggable Artifact Storage** (Session 9): qa.qaLocation enables flexible QA artifact organization

#### Design Philosophy:

13. **Progressive Disclosure Pattern** (Session 5): Templates minimal by default with extensive optional fields in examples section

14. **QA as Advisory Framework** (Session 9): Test Architect provides non-blocking guidance with structured artifacts

15. **Personification as Memory Aid** (Session 3): Agents have names (James, John, Sarah) not just roles

16. **Pragmatic Shortcuts** (Session 6): YOLO mode for experienced users who want to skip interactions

17. **Workflow Specialization** (Session 7): Only complex workflows (fullstack) have classification routing

18. **Embedded Intelligence** (Session 6): Checklists contain sophisticated LLM instructions, not just item lists

### What We're Really Documenting:

- Not just "what files exist" but "how the system thinks"
- Not just "what commands do" but "why they're structured this way"
- Not just "where things are" but "how they interact and why"
- The philosophy and patterns that make BMAD extensible for expansion packs

### Documentation Update Strategy:

When discovering patterns or insights:

1. **Don't just record them in this plan** - that's temporary notes
2. **Add them to the actual documentation** - that's where users look
3. **Cross-reference appropriately** - ensure documents link to related patterns
4. **Update the index (99-bmad-index.md)** - if adding new sections or documents
5. **Keep this plan as a record** - note what was found and where it went

## RETROSPECTIVE INSIGHTS (Patterns Discovered Through Verification):

### System Design Principles Revealed:

1. **Configuration Over Code**: Almost everything important is configurable (paths, modes, behaviors)
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple defaults with deep customization available
3. **Human-Friendly Abstractions**: Fuzzy matching, YOLO mode, agent names
4. **Context Minimalism**: Every loading decision optimizes for smaller contexts
5. **Indirect Knowledge Transfer**: Knowledge flows through tasks, not direct loading
6. **Runtime Flexibility**: Bindings happen at execution, not definition
7. **Role-Based Specialization**: Each component knows its lane and stays in it

### Expansion Pack Design Implications:

These patterns suggest expansion packs should:

- Use configuration for customization points
- Keep resources task-exclusive when possible
- Implement progressive disclosure in templates
- Create behavioral modifiers through data files
- Use personification for memorable agents
- Provide both interactive and YOLO modes
- Let tasks be the knowledge brokers, not agents directly
