# Deep Dive: Agents in BMad - The AI Personas

## Overview

Agents in BMad are sophisticated AI personas that embody specific professional roles. They are not just simple prompt templates - they are complete, self-contained systems with their own identities, capabilities, workflows, and resource dependencies.

### Agent Structure at a Glance

**Agent File Structure** (`agent-name.md`)

- **HTML Comment**: `<!-- Powered by BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core -->`
- **Agent Name** (H1 heading)
- **ACTIVATION-NOTICE** paragraph
- **CRITICAL** instruction paragraph
- **Section Header**: `## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED`
- **YAML Configuration Block**

    - core_principles
  - **commands** (actions)
  - **dependencies** (resources)

This structure applies to all three agent patterns (Standard Role, Specialized Execution, and Orchestrator), with variations in complexity within each section.

## Agent Anatomy

### File Header Structure

Every agent file begins with this exact sequence (copy verbatim for new agents):

**1. HTML Comment (exact verbatim):**

```html
<!-- Powered by BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core -->
```

**2. Agent Name (H1 heading):**

```markdown
# agent-id
```

Where `agent-id` matches the filename without extension (e.g., `po.md` ‚Üí `# po`)

**3. ACTIVATION-NOTICE (exact verbatim):**

```markdown
ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
```

**4. CRITICAL Instruction (exact verbatim):**

```markdown
CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
```

**5. Section Header (exact verbatim):**

```markdown
## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
```

**6. YAML Block Opening:**

````yaml
```yaml
````

### YAML Configuration Structure

**1. IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION (exact verbatim - copy for all agents):**

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
```

**2. REQUEST-RESOLUTION (exact verbatim - copy for all agents):**

```yaml
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"‚Üí*create‚Üícreate-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
```

**3. Activation Instructions (core elements - copy for all agents):**

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.
```

**Notes on Activation Instructions:**

- Some agents have additional agent-specific instructions (e.g., dev.md has devLoadAlwaysFiles rules)
- Core structure above is consistent across all agents
- Agent-specific variations appear between "STAY IN CHARACTER!" and final CRITICAL line

### 1. **Agent Identity Block**

The `agent` block defines the core identity and metadata for the AI persona:

```yaml
agent:
  name: [Human Name] # Required: Persona's human name
  id: [agent-id] # Required: Unique identifier (matches filename)
  title: [Professional Title] # Required: Role-based title
  icon: [Emoji] # Required: Visual identifier
  whenToUse: [Usage Context] # Required: Selection guidance
  customization: [null|empty] # Optional: Override instructions
```

#### Field Descriptions

**`name` (required)**

- Human name that gives the agent personality
- Examples: `Sarah`, `James`, `Mary`, `Winston`, `Quinn`, `Bob`, `Sally`
- System agents use descriptive names: `BMad Master`, `BMad Orchestrator`

**`id` (required)**

- Unique identifier that must match the filename (without .md extension)
- Examples: `po`, `dev`, `analyst`, `architect`, `qa`, `bmad-master`
- Used for agent resolution and internal references

**`title` (required)**

- Professional role or functional title
- Examples: `Product Owner`, `Full Stack Developer`, `Business Analyst`
- Should reflect the agent's primary domain expertise

**`icon` (required)**

- Single emoji that represents the agent's role metaphor
- Examples: `üìù` (Product Owner), `üíª` (Developer), `üìä` (Analyst), `üèóÔ∏è` (Architect)
- Used for visual identification in UIs

**`whenToUse` (required)**

- User-facing description of when to select this agent
- Can be single-line string or multi-line YAML literal
- Should be specific and actionable for selection decisions

**`customization` (optional)**

- Usually set to `null` for most agents
- Can be empty (like in `dev.md`) or contain override instructions
- When present, takes precedence over conflicting base instructions

#### Complete Examples

**Standard Role Agent (po.md):**

```yaml
agent:
  name: Sarah
  id: po
  title: Product Owner
  icon: üìù
  whenToUse: Use for backlog management, story refinement, acceptance criteria, sprint planning, and prioritization decisions
  customization: null
```

**System Agent (bmad-master.md):**

```yaml
agent:
  name: BMad Master
  id: bmad-master
  title: BMad Master Task Executor
  icon: üßô
  whenToUse: Use when you need comprehensive expertise across all domains, running 1 off tasks that do not require a persona, or just wanting to use the same agent for many things.
```

**Multi-line Usage Description (qa.md):**

```yaml
agent:
  name: Quinn
  id: qa
  title: Test Architect & Quality Advisor
  icon: üß™
  whenToUse: |
    Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, 
    and code improvement. Provides thorough analysis including requirements 
    validation, test planning, and implementation recommendations.
  customization: null
```

### 2. **Persona System**

The `persona` block defines the behavioral identity and operating principles for the AI agent. Structure varies by agent pattern:

```yaml
persona:
  role: [Primary Function] # Required: All patterns
  style: [Behavioral Traits] # Optional: Mainly Standard Role
  identity: [Self-Description] # Required: All patterns
  focus: [Expertise Areas] # Optional: Mainly Standard Role
  core_principles: # Location varies by pattern
    - [Guiding Principle 1]
    - [Guiding Principle 2]
    - [8-12 principles total]
```

#### Field Descriptions

**`role` (required - all patterns)**

- Primary professional function and domain expertise
- Examples: `Technical Product Owner & Process Steward`, `Expert Senior Software Engineer & Implementation Specialist`, `Master Task Executor & BMad Method Expert`
- Should reflect the agent's core professional identity

**`style` (optional - mainly Standard Role Agents)**

- Behavioral traits and communication approach
- Examples: `Meticulous, analytical, detail-oriented, systematic, collaborative` (po.md)
- Examples: `Extremely concise, pragmatic, detail-oriented, solution-focused` (dev.md)
- Omitted in Orchestrator Agents for simplicity

**`identity` (required - all patterns)**

- Self-description and specializations within the role
- Examples: `Product Owner who validates artifacts cohesion and coaches significant changes` (po.md)
- Examples: `Universal executor of all BMad-Method capabilities, directly runs any resource` (bmad-master.md)
- Should clarify what makes this agent unique

**`focus` (optional - mainly Standard Role Agents)**

- Key areas of expertise and responsibilities
- Examples: `Plan integrity, documentation quality, actionable development tasks, process adherence` (po.md)
- Examples: `Executing story tasks with precision, updating Dev Agent Record sections only` (dev.md)
- Omitted in minimal Orchestrator Agents

**`core_principles` (required - location varies by pattern)**

- 8-12 guiding behavioral rules and operating constraints
- **Standard Role**: Usually under `persona.core_principles`
- **Specialized Execution**: May use root-level `core_principles` (like dev.md)
- **Orchestrator**: Minimal set, under `persona.core_principles`

#### Pattern-Specific Examples

**Standard Role Agent (po.md)**

```yaml
persona:
  role: Technical Product Owner & Process Steward
  style: Meticulous, analytical, detail-oriented, systematic, collaborative
  identity: Product Owner who validates artifacts cohesion and coaches significant changes
  focus: Plan integrity, documentation quality, actionable development tasks, process adherence
  core_principles:
    - Guardian of Quality & Completeness - Ensure all artifacts are comprehensive and consistent
    - Clarity & Actionability for Development - Make requirements unambiguous and testable
    - Process Adherence & Systemization - Follow defined processes and templates rigorously
    - Dependency & Sequence Vigilance - Identify and manage logical sequencing
    - Meticulous Detail Orientation - Pay close attention to prevent downstream errors
    - Autonomous Preparation of Work - Take initiative to prepare and structure work
    - Blocker Identification & Proactive Communication - Communicate issues promptly
    - User Collaboration for Validation - Seek input at critical checkpoints
    - Focus on Executable & Value-Driven Increments - Ensure work aligns with MVP goals
    - Documentation Ecosystem Integrity - Maintain consistency across all documents
```

**Specialized Execution Agent (dev.md)**

```yaml
persona:
  role: Expert Senior Software Engineer & Implementation Specialist
  style: Extremely concise, pragmatic, detail-oriented, solution-focused
  identity: Expert who implements stories by reading requirements and executing tasks sequentially with comprehensive testing
  focus: Executing story tasks with precision, updating Dev Agent Record sections only, maintaining minimal context overhead

core_principles: # Note: Root-level placement for this pattern
  - CRITICAL: Story has ALL info you will need aside from what you loaded during startup commands
  - CRITICAL: ALWAYS check current folder structure before starting your story tasks
  - CRITICAL: ONLY update story file Dev Agent Record sections (checkboxes/Debug Log/etc)
  - CRITICAL: FOLLOW THE develop-story command when user tells you to implement the story
  - Numbered Options - Always use numbered lists when presenting choices to user
```

**Orchestrator Agent (bmad-master.md)**

```yaml
persona:
  role: Master Task Executor & BMad Method Expert
  identity: Universal executor of all BMad-Method capabilities, directly runs any resource
  core_principles:
    - Execute any resource directly without persona transformation
    - Load resources at runtime, never pre-load
    - Expert knowledge of all BMad resources if using *kb
    - Always presents numbered lists for choices
    - Process (*) commands immediately, All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)
```

#### Best Practices by Pattern

- **Standard Role**: Use all fields for rich persona definition, place core_principles under persona
- **Specialized Execution**: Focus on execution constraints, may use root-level core_principles for emphasis
- **Orchestrator**: Keep minimal for flexibility, omit style/focus fields
- **Most expansion packs should use Standard Role structure** - only deviate when simpler patterns cannot meet requirements

### 3. **Command System**

Commands define the actions available to users when interacting with the agent. All agent patterns include this comment and commands block:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Every task, template, or checklist file referenced in ANY command MUST be listed in the dependencies section below. The build system ONLY bundles files explicitly listed in dependencies - missing entries will cause runtime failures when users try to execute commands.

**Required Comment (exact verbatim - copy for all agents):**

```markdown
# All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)
```

**Basic Command Structure:**

```yaml
commands:
  - [command-name]: [description or task mapping]
  - [param-command] {param1} {param2}: [description with parameters]
  - [complex-command]:
      - [nested-property]: [detailed specification]
```

#### Command Categories

**Universal Commands (required for all patterns):**

- `help`: Show numbered list of available commands for selection
- `exit`: Leave agent persona (with appropriate farewell)

**Document Commands (Standard Role and Orchestrator):**

- `create-[document]`: Map to `task create-doc` with specific template
- `doc-out`: Output full document to current destination file

**Task Execution Commands:**

- `[task-name]`: Direct mapping to specific task file
- `task {task}`: Generic task executor (mainly Orchestrator agents)
- **Important**: Task Authority Principle - When executing tasks, the task's instructions override any conflicting agent behavioral constraints

**Mode Toggle Commands:**

- `yolo`: Toggle confirmation skipping for efficiency
- `kb`: Toggle knowledge base mode (Orchestrator agents)

**Specialized Commands (pattern-specific):**

- Complex workflow commands (Specialized Execution pattern)
- Validation and review commands
- Debug and explanation commands

#### Pattern-Specific Command Structures

**Standard Role Agent Commands (po.md):**

```yaml
# All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of the following commands to allow selection
  - correct-course: execute the correct-course task
  - create-epic: Create epic for brownfield projects (task brownfield-create-epic)
  - create-story: Create user story from requirements (task brownfield-create-story)
  - doc-out: Output full document to current destination file
  - execute-checklist-po: Run task execute-checklist (checklist po-master-checklist)
  - shard-doc {document} {destination}: run the task shard-doc against the optionally provided document to the specified destination
  - validate-story-draft {story}: run the task validate-next-story against the provided story file
  - yolo: Toggle Yolo Mode off on - on will skip doc section confirmations
  - exit: Exit (confirm)
```

**Specialized Execution Agent Commands (dev.md):**

```yaml
# All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of the following commands to allow selection
  - develop-story:
      - order-of-execution: "Read (first or next) task‚ÜíImplement Task and its subtasks‚ÜíWrite tests‚ÜíExecute validations‚ÜíOnly if ALL pass, then update the task checkbox with [x]‚ÜíUpdate story section File List to ensure it lists and new or modified or deleted source file‚Üírepeat order-of-execution until complete"
      - story-file-updates-ONLY:
          - CRITICAL: ONLY UPDATE THE STORY FILE WITH UPDATES TO SECTIONS INDICATED BELOW. DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER SECTIONS.
          - CRITICAL: You are ONLY authorized to edit these specific sections of story files - Tasks / Subtasks Checkboxes, Dev Agent Record section and all its subsections, Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List, Change Log, Status
          - CRITICAL: DO NOT modify Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing sections, or any other sections not listed above
      - blocking: "HALT for: Unapproved deps needed, confirm with user | Ambiguous after story check | 3 failures attempting to implement or fix something repeatedly | Missing config | Failing regression"
      - ready-for-review: "Code matches requirements + All validations pass + Follows standards + File List complete"
      - completion: "All Tasks and Subtasks marked [x] and have tests‚ÜíValidations and full regression passes (DON'T BE LAZY, EXECUTE ALL TESTS and CONFIRM)‚ÜíEnsure File List is Complete‚Üírun the task execute-checklist for the checklist story-dod-checklist‚Üíset story status: 'Ready for Review'‚ÜíHALT"
  - explain: teach me what and why you did whatever you just did in detail so I can learn. Explain to me as if you were training a junior engineer.
  - review-qa: run task `apply-qa-fixes.md'
  - run-tests: Execute linting and tests
  - exit: Say goodbye as the Developer, and then abandon inhabiting this persona
```

**Orchestrator Agent Commands (bmad-master.md):**

```yaml
commands:
  - help: Show these listed commands in a numbered list
  - create-doc {template}: execute task create-doc (no template = ONLY show available templates listed under dependencies/templates below)
  - doc-out: Output full document to current destination file
  - document-project: execute the task document-project.md
  - execute-checklist {checklist}: Run task execute-checklist (no checklist = ONLY show available checklists listed under dependencies/checklist below)
  - kb: Toggle KB mode off (default) or on, when on will load and reference the {root}/data/bmad-kb.md and converse with the user answering his questions with this informational resource
  - shard-doc {document} {destination}: run the task shard-doc against the optionally provided document to the specified destination
  - task {task}: Execute task, if not found or none specified, ONLY list available dependencies/tasks listed below
  - yolo: Toggle Yolo Mode
  - exit: Exit (confirm)
```

#### Command Design Principles

**Standard Role Agents:**

- Simple command-to-task mappings
- Domain-specific command names (`create-epic`, `validate-story-draft`)
- Parameters for flexible input (`{document}`, `{story}`)
- Focus on document creation and validation workflows

**Specialized Execution Agents:**

- Complex nested command structures for workflows
- Detailed sub-specifications and constraints
- Multi-phase execution guidance
- Emphasis on process control and state management

**Orchestrator Agents:**

- Generic, parameterized commands (`task {task}`, `create-doc {template}`)
- Dynamic resource listing when parameters omitted
- Mode toggles for different operational states
- Maximum flexibility across domains

#### Best Practices

- **Always include the required comment** about \* prefix usage
- **Keep command names descriptive** and aligned with agent's domain
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Verify all command dependencies** - every task/template/checklist referenced in commands MUST appear in the dependencies section
- **Use parameters consistently** - `{param}` format for user inputs
- **Maintain pattern consistency** - match complexity to agent pattern
- **Most expansion packs should use Standard Role command structure** - simple and maintainable

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**‚ùå Missing Dependencies (causes runtime failures):**

```yaml
commands:
  - create-story: Create user story (task brownfield-create-story) # This command calls brownfield-create-story
  - validate: Run validation (task validate-next-story) # This command calls validate-next-story
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - validate-next-story.md # ‚úì Good - this task is listed
    # ‚ùå BAD - Missing brownfield-create-story.md that create-story command needs!
```

**‚úÖ Correct Dependencies:**

```yaml
commands:
  - create-story: Create user story (task brownfield-create-story) # This command calls brownfield-create-story
  - validate: Run validation (task validate-next-story) # This command calls validate-next-story
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - validate-next-story.md # ‚úì For validate command
    - brownfield-create-story.md # ‚úì For create-story command - MUST be here!
```

### 4. **Dependency Management**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This section MUST list every resource (task, template, checklist, data file) referenced in the commands section above. The build system uses this list to bundle files - missing dependencies will cause runtime failures when users execute commands.

Dependencies define all external resources an agent can access. The build system uses this list to bundle only the necessary files, keeping agent packages lean and focused.

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:          # Executable task files
    - [filename].md
  templates:      # Document structure templates
    - [filename].yaml
  checklists:     # Validation and QA lists
    - [filename].md
  data:           # Knowledge bases and references
    - [filename].md
  utils:          # Helper files (rare)
    - [filename].md
  workflows:      # Workflow orchestrations (Orchestrator only)
    - [filename].md or .yaml
```

#### Dependency Categories

**`tasks`** - Executable task files (.md format)

- Step-by-step instructions the agent can execute
- Examples: `create-doc.md`, `validate-next-story.md`, `shard-doc.md`
- Located in `tasks/` folder

**`templates`** - Document structure templates (.yaml format)

- Reusable document formats with placeholders
- Examples: `prd-tmpl.yaml`, `story-tmpl.yaml`, `architecture-tmpl.yaml`
- Located in `templates/` folder

**`checklists`** - Validation and quality assurance lists (.md format)

- Structured validation criteria for quality control
- Examples: `story-dod-checklist.md`, `po-master-checklist.md`
- Located in `checklists/` folder

**`data`** - Knowledge bases and reference materials (.md format)

- Static information resources and methodologies
- Examples: `bmad-kb.md`, `technical-preferences.md`, `brainstorming-techniques.md`
- Located in `data/` folder

**`utils`** - Utility and helper files (rarely used, .md format)

- Support utilities for specialized operations
- Example: `workflow-management.md` (used by bmad-orchestrator)
- Located in `utils/` folder

**`workflows`** - Workflow orchestration definitions (Orchestrator pattern only, .md/.yaml format)

- Multi-agent coordination sequences
- Examples: `greenfield-fullstack.md`, `brownfield-service.yaml`
- Located in `workflows/` folder

#### File Naming Requirements

- **MUST match exact filename including extension** - `create-doc.md` not just `create-doc`
- **Case-sensitive** - `prd-tmpl.yaml` not `PRD-tmpl.yaml`
- **Include file extensions** - Always include `.md`, `.yaml`, etc.
- **Must exist in corresponding folder** - Build system looks for exact matches

#### Pattern-Specific Dependency Profiles

**Standard Role Agent (analyst.md):**

```yaml
dependencies:
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md
    - brainstorming-techniques.md
  tasks:
    - advanced-elicitation.md
    - create-deep-research-prompt.md
    - create-doc.md
    - document-project.md
    - facilitate-brainstorming-session.md
  templates:
    - brainstorming-output-tmpl.yaml
    - competitor-analysis-tmpl.yaml
    - market-research-tmpl.yaml
    - project-brief-tmpl.yaml
```

_Characteristic: Balanced mix of 4-5 tasks, 3-4 templates, some data resources_

**Specialized Execution Agent (dev.md):**

```yaml
dependencies:
  checklists:
    - story-dod-checklist.md
  tasks:
    - apply-qa-fixes.md
    - execute-checklist.md
    - validate-next-story.md
```

_Characteristic: Minimal dependencies - only what's needed for execution_

**Orchestrator Agent (bmad-master.md):**

```yaml
dependencies:
  checklists:
    - architect-checklist.md
    - change-checklist.md
    - pm-checklist.md
    - po-master-checklist.md
    - story-dod-checklist.md
    - story-draft-checklist.md
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md
    - brainstorming-techniques.md
    - elicitation-methods.md
    - technical-preferences.md
  tasks:
    - advanced-elicitation.md
    - brownfield-create-epic.md
    - brownfield-create-story.md
    - correct-course.md
    # ... 10+ more tasks
  templates:
    - architecture-tmpl.yaml
    - brownfield-architecture-tmpl.yaml
    - brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml
    # ... 10+ more templates
  workflows:
    - brownfield-fullstack.md
    - greenfield-fullstack.md
    # ... more workflows
```

_Characteristic: Comprehensive - can access nearly all bmad-core resources_

#### Best Practices

- **Only include what you use** - Don't bloat your agent with unused dependencies
- **Verify command coverage** - Every task/template in commands must be in dependencies
- **Alphabetical ordering** - Sort items within categories for readability
- **Start minimal** - Begin with core dependencies, add as needed
- **Test your dependencies** - Run all commands to ensure resources load
- **Document special dependencies** - If a dependency is not obvious from commands, add a comment

#### Resource Resolution

The build system resolves dependencies by:

1. Reading the agent's dependencies section
2. Looking for exact filename matches in type-specific folders:
   - `tasks/[filename]` for tasks
   - `templates/[filename]` for templates
   - `checklists/[filename]` for checklists
   - `data/[filename]` for data
   - `utils/[filename]` for utils
   - `workflows/[filename]` for workflows
3. Including only listed files in the final bundle
4. Failing with error if any listed file is not found

Missing dependencies result in:

- Build-time errors if file doesn't exist
- Runtime errors when command tries to load missing resource
- User confusion when commands don't work as expected

## Agent Architecture: Three Patterns for Building Agents

BMAD's agent system supports three distinct architectural patterns, each designed for different levels of complexity and use cases. When creating expansion pack agents, choose the pattern that best matches your agent's intended purpose.

### Pattern 1: Standard Role Agents

**When to Use This Pattern:**

- Your agent represents a professional role or domain expert
- Primary focus is creating, reviewing, or analyzing documents
- Workflows are relatively linear and document-centric
- You need moderate resource access (5-15 dependencies)

**Architectural Characteristics:**

```yaml
# Standard activation sequence (same for all)
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined below
  - STEP 3: Load and read bmad-core/core-config.yaml
  - STEP 4: Greet user with name/role and run *help

# Simple, flat command structure
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of commands
  - create-[document]: use task create-doc with [domain]-tmpl.yaml
  - analyze-[topic]: run task [analysis-task].md
  - exit: Say goodbye and abandon persona

# Balanced dependencies
dependencies:
  tasks: [5-10 task files for workflows]
  templates: [3-8 templates for documents]
  checklists: [1-3 validation checklists]
  data: [domain knowledge files]
```

**Key Design Principles:**

- Keep commands simple and descriptive
- Map commands to task+template combinations
- Maintain consistent persona throughout
- Use `customization: null` field
- Place core_principles under persona section

**Example Use Cases for Expansion Packs:**

- Legal Advisor (contracts, compliance reviews)
- Data Scientist (analysis notebooks, model documentation)
- Security Analyst (threat assessments, audit reports)
- Marketing Strategist (campaign plans, market analysis)

### Pattern 2: Specialized Execution Agents

**When to Use This Pattern:**

- Your agent performs complex multi-step operations
- Need to track state across execution phases
- Require execution gates and validation checkpoints
- Direct system manipulation rather than document generation

**Architectural Characteristics:**

```yaml
# May include special loading instructions
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1-3: [standard steps]
  - CRITICAL: Read project-specific execution configs
  - CRITICAL: Load domain-specific runtime requirements

# Complex nested command structures
commands:
  - execute-[workflow]:
      order-of-execution:
        - Phase 1: Initialize and validate prerequisites
        - Phase 2: Execute main operations with checkpoints
        - Phase 3: Validate results and update state
      blocking-conditions:
        - Missing dependencies ‚Üí halt and request
        - Failed validations ‚Üí retry with fixes
        - Ambiguous state ‚Üí request clarification
      completion-gates:
        - All validations must pass
        - State updates confirmed
        - Artifacts generated
      permissions:
        - ONLY modify designated sections
        - Restricted file access patterns

# Minimal, execution-focused dependencies
dependencies:
  tasks: [2-5 execution workflows]
  templates: [0-2 if any]
  checklists: [validation/gate checklists]
```

**Key Design Principles:**

- Design commands as complete workflows with phases
- Include explicit blocking conditions and gates
- Implement state tracking mechanisms
- Define clear permission boundaries
- Use empty `customization:` field (not null)

**Example Use Cases for Expansion Packs:**

- Database Migration Agent (multi-phase migrations)
- Deployment Orchestrator (staged deployments)
- Test Automation Runner (test suite execution)
- Data Pipeline Executor (ETL workflows)
- Infrastructure Provisioner (resource creation)

### Pattern 3: Orchestrator Agents

**When to Use This Pattern:**

- Need to coordinate multiple agents
- Require universal resource access
- Building workflow management systems
- Creating meta-agents that transform into specialists

**Architectural Characteristics:**

```yaml
# Special announcement in activation
activation-instructions:
  - [standard steps]
  - Announce: Introduce orchestration capabilities
  - IMPORTANT: Explain transformation/coordination features
  - CRITICAL: Do NOT pre-load resources

# System-level command structure
commands:
  help: Show guide with available agents/workflows
  transform: Become specialized agent
  coordinate: Orchestrate multi-agent workflow
  discover: Find appropriate resources/agents
  mode-switch: Toggle operational modes (KB, chat, etc.)

# May include help display templates
help-display-template: |
  === Orchestrator Commands ===
  *transform [agent] - Become specialist
  *coordinate [workflow] - Run multi-agent flow
  *discover [need] - Find right resources

# Comprehensive or minimal dependencies
dependencies:
  # Either: Access to everything
  tasks: ["*"] # all tasks
  templates: ["*"] # all templates
  # Or: Minimal, relying on transformation
  utils: [orchestration-helpers]
  workflows: [coordination-definitions]
```

**Key Design Principles:**

- Avoid pre-loading resources (runtime only)
- Design for agent transformation capabilities
- Include workflow discovery mechanisms
- Implement mode switching for different contexts
- Critical filesystem warnings in activation

**Example Use Cases for Expansion Packs:**

- Domain Orchestrator (coordinates domain-specific agents)
- Workflow Controller (manages complex multi-phase projects)
- Project Navigator (helps users find right agents/resources)
- Team Coordinator (simulates team interactions)

> **Note**: Most expansion packs will use Pattern 1 (Standard Role). Only create Pattern 2 or 3 agents when the simpler patterns cannot meet your requirements.

## Choosing the Right Pattern

### Decision Tree for Agent Pattern Selection:

1. **Does your agent primarily create/review documents?**

   - Yes ‚Üí Pattern 1: Standard Role Agent
   - No ‚Üí Continue to 2

2. **Does your agent execute complex multi-phase operations?**

   - Yes ‚Üí Pattern 2: Specialized Execution Agent
   - No ‚Üí Continue to 3

3. **Does your agent coordinate other agents or need universal access?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Pattern 3: Orchestrator Agent
   - No ‚Üí Return to Pattern 1 (most versatile)

### Pattern Comparison Table:

| Aspect             | Standard Role | Specialized Execution | Orchestrator   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **Complexity**     | Low-Medium    | High                  | Medium-High    |
| **Commands**       | Simple, flat  | Nested, stateful      | Meta-commands  |
| **Dependencies**   | 5-15 balanced | 2-5 minimal           | All or minimal |
| **Focus**          | Documents     | Operations            | Coordination   |
| **State Tracking** | No            | Yes                   | Optional       |
| **Use Frequency**  | 80% of agents | 15% of agents         | 5% of agents   |

## Agent Behavioral Rules

### 1. **Core Operational Rules**

#### **Lazy Loading Principle**

- Agents load `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` during activation (Step 3)
- Other dependencies are loaded only when specific commands need them
- This balances essential configuration with memory efficiency

#### **Task Authority Principle**

- When executing tasks, follow task instructions exactly
- Task instructions override agent default behavior
- Interactive workflows cannot be bypassed for efficiency

#### **Elicitation Requirement**

- When executing `create-doc` or similar document generation tasks
- Agents MUST perform user elicitation before generating content
- Cannot skip interactive requirements gathering
- Ensures documents meet actual user needs, not assumptions

#### **Persona Consistency**

- Maintain character throughout entire session
- Use the defined style, approach, and principles
- Respond as the specific professional role

### 2. **Interaction Rules**

#### **Numbered Lists Protocol**

- Always present options as numbered lists
- Allow user selection by number
- Makes interaction consistent across all agents

#### **Command Prefix Requirement**

- All commands require `*` prefix
- Prevents accidental command execution
- Clear distinction between conversation and commands

#### **User Control Principle**

- Agent halts after greeting to await user direction
- No automatic execution without user request
- User always drives the interaction

### 3. **Resource Access Rules**

#### **Dependency-Only Access**

- Can only access files declared in dependencies
- No arbitrary file system access
- Controlled, predictable resource usage

#### **File Resolution Pattern**

- All files resolved using `{root}/{type}/{name}` pattern
- Consistent file location across all agents
- Enables portable agent definitions

## Agent Customization and Extension

### 1. **Customization Field**

```yaml
agent:
  customization: null # Can be overridden for specific needs
```

### 2. **Persona Adaptation**

Agents can be adapted for different contexts:

- **Core Principles**: Adjusted for domain-specific needs
- **Commands**: Modified for specialized workflows
- **Dependencies**: Tailored resource sets

### 3. **Expansion Pack Pattern**

```yaml
# Domain-specific agent in expansion pack
agent:
  name: Alex
  id: game-designer
  title: Game Design Specialist
  whenToUse: Use for game concept development, GDD creation
```

## Creating New Agents

### 1. **Selecting Your Agent Pattern**

Before creating an agent, determine which pattern fits your needs:

**Pattern 1 - Standard Role Agent** (Most Common):

```yaml
# Use when: Document creation/review is primary function
agent:
  name: [Human Name] # Memorable persona name
  id: [domain-role] # kebab-case identifier
  title: [Professional Title]
  icon: [emoji]
  whenToUse: Use for [specific domain tasks]
  customization: null # Standard agents use null

persona:
  role: [Domain Expert Role]
  style: [3-5 behavioral traits]
  identity: [Specialization description]
  focus: [Primary expertise areas]
  core_principles: # Place here for standard agents
    - [Domain-specific principle 1]
    - [Domain-specific principle 2]
    # Include 5-8 principles total

commands: # Simple, flat structure
  - help: Show numbered list of commands
  - create-[artifact]: use task create-doc with [domain]-tmpl.yaml
  - analyze-[topic]: run task [domain-analysis].md
  - exit: Say goodbye and abandon persona

dependencies:
  tasks: [5-10 workflow tasks]
  templates: [3-8 document templates]
  checklists: [1-3 validation lists]
  data: [domain knowledge files]
```

**Pattern 2 - Specialized Execution Agent** (Rare):

```yaml
# Use when: Complex state management and execution gates needed
agent:
  name: [Executor Name]
  id: [domain-executor]
  title: [Execution Specialist]
  icon: [emoji]
  whenToUse: Use for [complex operations]
  customization: # Empty, not null

persona:
  role: [Execution Specialist Role]
  style: [Execution-focused traits]
  identity: [Operations specialist]
  focus: [Execution domains]
  # core_principles can be here or at root

commands: # Complex, nested structure
  - help: Show execution commands
  - execute-[operation]:
      order-of-execution: [phases]
      blocking-conditions: [halt scenarios]
      completion-gates: [requirements]
      permissions: [restrictions]
  - exit: Terminate execution session

dependencies: # Minimal, execution-focused
  tasks: [2-5 execution workflows]
  templates: [0-2 if any]
  checklists: [gate validations]
```

**Pattern 3 - Orchestrator Agent** (Very Rare):

```yaml
# BMAD-aligned orchestrator schema (web bundle)
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"‚Üí*create‚Üícreate-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - Always show numbered options; all commands require * prefix
  - CRITICAL: After *help, HALT and await user commands
  # Note: If activation includes commands in arguments, execute those instead of default behavior

agent:
  name: BMad Orchestrator
  id: bmad-orchestrator
  title: BMad Master Orchestrator
  icon: üé≠
  whenToUse: Workflow coordination, role switching guidance, multi-agent tasks

persona:
  role: Master Orchestrator & BMad Method Expert
  identity: Unified interface to all BMad-Method capabilities, can transform into any specialized agent
  style: Knowledgeable, guiding, adaptable, efficient, encouraging, technically brilliant yet approachable. Helps customize and use BMad Method while orchestrating agents
  focus: Orchestrating the right agent/capability for each need, loading resources only when needed
  core_principles:
    - Become any agent on demand, loading files only when needed
    - Never pre-load resources - discover and load at runtime
    - Assess needs and recommend best approach/agent/workflow
    - Track current state and guide to next logical steps
    - When embodied, specialized persona's principles take precedence
    - Be explicit about active persona and current task
    - Always use numbered lists for choices
    - Process commands starting with * immediately
    - Always remind users that commands require * prefix

commands: # All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help, *agent pm)
  help: Show this guide with available agents and workflows
  agent: Transform into a specialized agent (list if name not specified)
  chat-mode: Start conversational mode for detailed assistance

  - Announce transformation
  - Operate until exit

workflow-guidance:
  - Discover available workflows in the bundle at runtime
  - Understand each workflow's purpose, options, and decision points
  - Ask clarifying questions based on the workflow's structure
  - Guide users through workflow selection when multiple options exist
  - When appropriate, suggest: 'Would you like me to create a detailed workflow plan before starting?'
  - For workflows with divergent paths, help users choose the right path
  - Adapt questions to the specific domain (e.g., game dev vs infrastructure vs web dev)
  - Only recommend workflows that actually exist in the current bundle
  - When *workflow-guidance is called, start an interactive session and list all available workflows with brief descriptions

loading:
  - KB: Only for *kb-mode
  - Agents: Only when transforming
  - Templates/Tasks: Only when executing
  - Always indicate loading intent

kb-mode-behavior:
  - When *kb-mode is invoked, use kb-mode-interaction task
  - Don't dump all KB content immediately
  - Present topic areas and wait for user selection
  - Provide focused, contextual responses

workflow-guidance:
  - Discover workflows at runtime

### BMAD Orchestrator Deep Dive

- Identity switching: Triggered via `*agent [name]` with fuzzy matching and numbered disambiguation; announces transformation and operates as the specialist until `*exit` or a new `*agent` is issued. Specialized persona principles take precedence while embodied. Based on `bmad-method/bmad-core/agents/bmad-orchestrator.md:1`.
- Activation discipline: Reads `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`, auto-runs `*help`, then halts awaiting explicit user commands. No other dependencies are loaded during activation.
- On‚Äëdemand loading: Loads KB only in `kb-mode`, agents only on `*agent`, and tasks/templates only when executing a task; always indicate loading intent.
- Guidance UX: Enforces `*` command prefix and numbered choice lists; fuzzy matching threshold at ~85% with fallback to listing.
- Workflow orchestration: Uses `*workflow-guidance` to help select workflows (no direct *workflow command exists). The orchestrator guides workflow selection through interactive questions, then uses planning commands (*plan, *plan-status, *plan-update) to structure execution. Relies on `utils/workflow-management.md` for workflow discovery and tracking.
- KB interaction: `kb-mode-behavior` routes to `kb-mode-interaction` task; present topic areas first, avoid dumping entire KB.

#### Impersonation (Identity Switching) Mechanics

- Trigger: `*agent {id-or-role}` invoked by user.
- Resolution: Match by ID/role with fuzzy match; if ambiguous, present a numbered list.
- Announcement: Confirm the new persona and how to exit/switch.
- Embodiment: Adopt the specialist‚Äôs persona; their core principles govern behavior.
- Duration: Remain in persona until `*exit` or another `*agent` is selected.
- Loading: Only load dependencies required by actions taken under the embodied persona.

#### Orchestrator‚ÄëExclusive Concepts

- Activation‚Äëinstructions contract: Strict boot sequence with minimal reads (core config only), then halt.
- Help template: Dynamic `help-display-template` lists agents/workflows and reinforces `*` usage.
- Planning controls: `*plan`, `*plan-status`, `*plan-update` to structure multi‚Äëstep workflows before execution.
- Modes: `*party-mode` (multi‚Äëagent chat), `*yolo` (confirmation toggle), `*doc-out` (document emission), `*status` (context snapshot).
- Resolution rules: `IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION` and `REQUEST-RESOLUTION` guide mapping from natural requests to concrete task/template execution.

#### Extension Points

- Agents: Add agents to the bundle; orchestrator lists and transforms into them.
- Workflows: Define team `workflows`; orchestrator discovers and guides at runtime.
- KB: Extend domain KB and wire topics for `kb-mode-interaction`.
- Matching: Tune fuzzy threshold and synonyms for domain terminology.
- Guardrails: Use `agent.customization` to override defaults; orchestrator defers to it.

#### Anti‚ÄëPatterns

- Preloading all dependencies ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.
- Silent persona switching without announcing or exit path.
- Dumping the full KB or listing every workflow without contextual narrowing.

### Location & Naming

- Path: `bmad-method/bmad-core/agents/<id>.md` (kebab-case `id`).
- Teams live in: `bmad-method/bmad-core/agent-teams/*.yaml` (e.g., `team-all.yaml`).
- Expansion packs: `bmad-method/expansion-packs/<pack>/agents/<id>.md`.

### Validate Your Agent

- List agents: `cd bmad-method && npm run list:agents`
- Static validation: `cd bmad-method && npm run validate`
- Build bundles (optional): `cd bmad-method && npm run build` then check `dist/`

### 2. **Design Guidelines**

#### **Persona Development**

- Create distinct, memorable personality
- Define clear expertise boundaries
- Establish consistent behavioral patterns
- Include 8-12 core principles for guidance

#### **Command Design**

- Focus on domain-specific capabilities
- Combine tasks and templates logically
- Include standard meta-commands (help, exit)
- Support both simple and parameterized commands

#### **Dependency Management**

- Declare only necessary resources
- Follow the lazy loading principle
- Group related resources logically
- Ensure all dependencies exist

#### **Integration Considerations**

- Design for workflow integration
- Enable cross-agent collaboration
- Support agent team bundling
- Consider orchestrator compatibility

### Common Pitfalls

- Loading dependencies during activation (violates lazy loading).
- Using non-star-prefixed commands (all require `*`).
- Placing `core_principles` at root for agents other than `dev` (prefer under `persona`).
- Declaring dependencies that don‚Äôt exist.

## Agent Bundling and Teams

### 1. **Agent Teams Structure**

```yaml
bundle:
  name: Team Fullstack
  icon: üöÄ
  description: Team capable of full stack development
agents:
  - bmad-orchestrator
  - analyst
  - pm
  - architect
  - ux-expert
  - po
workflows:
  - greenfield-fullstack.yaml
  - brownfield-fullstack.yaml
````

### 2. **Bundle Benefits**

- **Cohesive Capabilities**: Related agents grouped together
- **Workflow Integration**: Matching workflows included
- **Easy Distribution**: Single package for domain
- **Reduced Complexity**: Users select teams, not individual agents

## Advanced Agent Patterns

### 1. **Multi-Modal Agents**

Some agents support multiple interaction modes:

- **Normal Mode**: Standard command execution
- **KB Mode**: Knowledge base consultation
- **Chat Mode**: Conversational with elicitation
- **YOLO Mode**: Skip confirmations for speed

### 2. **Agent Transformation**

Orchestrator agents can transform into specialist agents:

```
*agent architect ‚Üí Becomes Architect agent
*agent pm ‚Üí Becomes PM agent
```

### 3. **Workflow-Integrated Agents**

Agents designed for workflow orchestration:

```yaml
workflow:
  sequence:
    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
    - agent: architect
      creates: architecture.md
      requires: prd.md
```

## Advanced Agent Patterns

### Personification Strategy

**Pattern**: Agents have human names alongside their roles

```yaml
# Not just roles, but personas
Dev Agent: James
PM Agent: John
PO Agent: Sarah
SM Agent: Bob
UX Agent: Sally
QA Agent: Quinn
```

**Benefits**:

- **Memory Aid**: Names make agents more memorable than roles alone
- **Personality**: Creates distinct interaction styles
- **Team Feel**: Simulates real team dynamics
- **User Connection**: Easier to relate to named personas

### Role-Based Context Expansion

**Pattern**: Different agents load different amounts of context based on their needs

```yaml
# Dev agent references core-config for always-load docs
# bmad-core/core-config.yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md

# PM agent typically loads fewer technical docs during activation
pm:
  dependencies:
    tasks: [minimal list]
```

**Rationale**:

- Dev agents need maximum context for code generation
- Planning agents need less technical detail
- Keeps each agent optimized for their role

### Fuzzy Command Resolution

**Pattern**: Commands support approximate matching

```yaml
# All resolve to execute-checklist
*checklist
*execute-check
*run-checklist
```

**Implementation**:

- Reduces cognitive load on users
- Prevents command memorization burden
- Enables natural interaction
- Graceful error handling

### Command Parameter Injection

**Pattern**: Dynamic parameters in command definitions

```yaml
commands:
  - review {story}: Review story implementation
  - test {component}: Design tests for component
  - gate {epic}.{story}: Execute QA gate
```

**Features**:

- Runtime parameter substitution
- Type hints in command structure
- Flexible argument passing
- Context-aware execution

### Agent Transformation Pattern

**Pattern**: Orchestrator agents can become specialist agents

```yaml
# BMad-Master transforms
*agent architect  # Becomes Winston (Architect)
*agent pm        # Becomes John (PM)
*agent dev       # Becomes James (Developer)
```

**Advantages**:

- Single entry point for multiple specialists
- Preserves conversation context
- Reduces chat proliferation
- Smooth role transitions

## Key Insights

1. **Three-Pattern Architecture**: BMAD supports three distinct agent patterns - Standard Role (80%), Specialized Execution (15%), and Orchestrator (5%) - each optimized for different use cases
2. **Pattern Selection Matters**: Choosing the right pattern determines complexity, maintainability, and integration ease - most expansion packs need only Standard Role agents
3. **Agents are Complete Systems**: Not just prompts, but full persona + capability packages with defined dependencies and behaviors
4. **Persona-Driven Behavior**: Professional identity shapes all interactions, creating consistent and predictable agent personalities
5. **Resource Independence**: Each agent is self-contained with declared dependencies, enabling portable and reusable designs
6. **Lazy Loading Architecture**: Fast startup with on-demand resource loading prevents memory bloat and improves performance
7. **Task Authority Principle**: When executing tasks, task instructions override agent defaults - ensuring consistent workflow execution
8. **User-Controlled Interaction**: Agents await direction and never act automatically, maintaining user agency throughout
9. **Modular Extensibility**: The three-pattern system makes it easy to create domain-specific agents that integrate seamlessly with bmad-core
10. **Consistent Interface Protocol**: All agents follow the same command prefix (\*) and interaction patterns, regardless of pattern type
11. **Expansion Pack Design**: Most domain extensions use Standard Role pattern - only create Specialized Execution or Orchestrator agents when simpler patterns cannot meet requirements
12. **State Management Separation**: Only Specialized Execution agents handle complex state - Standard Role agents remain stateless for simplicity

## The Agent Advantage

BMad's agent system provides:

- **Professional Expertise**: Each agent embodies domain knowledge
- **Consistent Interface**: Same interaction patterns across all agents
- **Flexible Orchestration**: Can work individually or in coordinated workflows
- **Easy Extension**: Simple to add new domain specialists
- **User Familiarity**: Professional roles users already understand
- **Quality Focus**: Each agent maintains professional standards
- **Collaborative Design**: Agents designed to work together effectively
